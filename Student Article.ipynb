    "With exam period approaching fast, every student is wondering how to score the best possible grade. Some factors like how much sleep you're getting or how healthy you are can seem like obviously correlated to your final grade. What about your relationship status? How much should you be studying to achieve the grade you want? Does the subject you're studying influences your final grade? In this article, we will use two datasets containing student maths and Portuguese language performance in two different Portuguese schools and see which factors affected student performance the most. \n",
